# Sentiment-Analysis-Hotel-Reviews
A comparitive analysis of different supervised learning classification algorithms for Sentiment Analysis of Hotel Reviews using Machine learning techniques.

Introduction

Hotel reviews are of great importance for customers as well as the hotels and with the tremendous growth of tourism there has been an increase in competition in the hotel industry, hence to stay ahead of their competitors it often becomes necessary for the hotels to analyse the negative reviews they receive and work on them. Therefore, with the ongoing research in sentiment analysis in machine learning we decided to apply this technique to classify hotel reviews as positive or negative ones in this project.
